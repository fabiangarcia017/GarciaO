        Networks and networking have grown exponentially over the last 20 years—understandably
so. They’ve had to evolve at light speed just to keep up with huge increases in basic missioncritical user needs ranging from sharing data and printers to more advanced demands
like videoconferencing. Unless everyone who needs to share network resources is located
in the same office area (an increasingly uncommon situation), the challenge is to connect
the sometimes large number of relevant networks together so all users can share the networks’ wealth.

        Let’s take a look at how communication happens on a basic local area network
(LAN), which I started to discuss in Chapter 1, “Introduction to Networks.” Starting with
Figure 4.1

        <p> you get a picture of a basic LAN network that’s connected together using an Ethernet connection to a hub. This network is actually one collision domain and one broadcast
            domain, but don’t stress if you have no idea what this means as I’ll start to cover those terms
            in this chapter; however, I’m going to talk about both collision and broadcast domains in
            depth in Chapter 5, “Networking Devices.”</p>
